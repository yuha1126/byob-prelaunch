A Youtube Data API analytics project written in Flutter Dart.

This repo contains an application that lets you enter a youtube channel's username and it returns data related to the input channel.

Displays information such as channel name, the channel description, subscriber count, view count, and video count.

Future implementations:
- allow the application to display multiple channels at once
- display the data in graphs for better comprehension
- better error checking for cases when the channel is not found or contains private information
- clearer UI
